            Sabalan (Persian: سبلان [sæbæ'lɒːn]) is an inactive stratovolcano
             in Ardabil Province of northwestern Iran.

            At 4,794 metres (15,728 ft) in elevation, it is the third-highest 
            mountain in Iran. It has a permanent crater lake formed at its summit.
            On one of its slopes around 3,600 metres (11,800 ft) in elevation
            there are large rock formations of eroded volcanic outcrops that
            resemble animals, birds, and insects.
